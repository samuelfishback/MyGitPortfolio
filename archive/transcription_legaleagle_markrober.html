      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Alright. Thee- the man
        himself, Mark Rober. Uh, thanks so much for, uh, for joining today.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Good to be here. Let's
        get to the bottom of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Out of curiosity, at
        this point, how much glitter and fart spray do you think you've gone
        through?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Like in- like w-what
        metric? By- by pounds or by, like, number of boxes?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Well, I mean, uh, you
        know, you're a NASA engineer, so, uh, you know, gr-kilograms, probably
        more than pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: (laughs) We gotta stick
        with freedom units.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: (laughs)</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: We're talking probably,
        like, 44 pounds of glitter. So, that's like 20 kilograms, give or take
        of- uh, don't quote me on that -ish, uh, kilograms of glitter. And I
        would say, probably, we've gotten, like, 50 boxes stolen or somethin'.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Wow.</p>
      <p><strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: At this point.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: And I know that you've
        gotten law enforcement involved; both in the porch thieves and on
        tracking down some honest-to-goodness scammers who were taking advantage
        of, uh, you know, sometimes the elderly. Um. Has anything come from
        that, uh, coordination with law enforcement?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: So, (clears throat)
        we've literally had, like, Department of Justice, like, FBI, Homeland
        Security, Scottland Yard, INTERPOL, like, all of them at some point, in
        some capacity have reached out, um, including, like, I think it was,
        like, Microsoft's fraud team, like, companies as well. We will just give
        them our information and we'll just, like, "Here you go, do with it what
        you want." They generally don't follow back with us and-and say what
        happened, for whatever reason. It's not necessarily a two-way street. If
        we're looking for, like- with like, local jurisdiction, like this year
        (swallows) we're gonna work with San Francisco PD and-and, kind of
        tackle the car- uh, people smashing and grabbing, uh, cars and, like,
        stuff from cars. So, if we're working more like that, then-then there's
        more back-and-forth but otherwise, uh, we just kind of, just, give 'em
        all the data and let them do with it what they will. They have told us
        they like what we're doing. A: because it's like we do stuff technically
        that they just won't, for what- don't have the resources or ability to
        do it in their department. But B: we can get away with stuff that they
        can't do because we're, like, private citizens, I guess. But, somehow
        they could use that information so it's, like, in certain cases they'll
        be like, "no, we love what you're doin', please keep doin' it," for
        whatever reason they're either legally or constrained from a resource
        standpoint- can't do it, so they love when we f-feed 'em whatever we
        get.
      </p>
      <!--2:20-->
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Yeah. Well, I mean,
        that's- that's a great example, uh, y-you know, the police are bound by
        the Constitution. Uh.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Pfft! Lame!</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: (laughs) Yeah,
        theoretically. Theoretically, they should be bound by the Constitution
        and, you know, you get people saying, "Oh, that infringes on my First
        Amendment rights," when it doesn't actually involve the government and
        the First Amendment doesn't apply to anything but the government. You
        are a private citizen so there are- there are rules that, um, define
        what the government can do with information that's created by private
        citizens. Mark, I noticed that a lot of the people in your videos, uh,
        have blurred faces. Uh, is there a particular reason why- why you do
        that?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Uh, we might as well
        just state it on your channel. I put this in descriptions sometimes.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Sure.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: But basically, if
        someone doesn't sign a release, I don't- their face is then blurred and,
        uh, I don't wanna ruin anyone's life over, like, a stupid decision to,
        like, steal a package. So, by default, faces are blurred. If you see a
        face that's not blurred that's because they signed a release and we went
        back later and said, "Hey, uh, will you sign a release so I could put
        this in a dumb video?" And, uh, and they've signed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Are you able to- to
        prevent future, uh, package thieves?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: It's kind of a
        case-by-case basis. There's one two years ago, these two college
        students took it and, uh, uh, they were hilarious. I didn't end up
        turning their f-footage to the police or anything but then Discover
        Channel- we're doing something. So, then Discover Channel tracked them
        down and then I interviewed them. And I was like, I asked them, like,
        "So, have you guys stolen any packages since?" And they're, like, "Ah
        man, I got in so much trouble from my mom and my grandma," and then
        they're like, you know, someone else- a package came to their house
        accidentally, just shipped to the wrong address and he's like, "I
        frickin' personally walked that thing to Georgia where it, you know,
        where- where it actually was supposed to delivered to," cause it's like,
        "I didn't want anything to do with it." He was like, "I was gonna go
        through hell or high water to make sure it got to the right person." So
        I was like, "Ah, well, my job is done here." You know? I think they
        learned their lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Well, uh, Mark it- if
        Batman had a YouTube channel, I think he would aspire to- to do exactly
        what you're doing. Um, I-I think you're doin' really good work. Uh, my
        final question for you is: If Mark Rober found himself in jail, how
        would he engineer his way out of imprisonment?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: (laughs) Ah, man.
        That's- I mean, what kinda jail is it? I gotta know, like, what the
        weaknesses are, right? And I- a- it- it usually, I think, those things
        come down to a little bit of, like, combination of social engineering.
        You kinda gotta observe, know when the guards gone rest, make friends
        with the guard, you know? Depends on how long the jail sentence was
        because, also, I'm not gonna, like, break out if that gives me, like, 20
        more years. So, you gotta balance it all. But, uh, yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Let's say you're
        wrongfully imprisoned for life. You are a completely innocent man but
        you have no hope of parole and you're in- you're in Alcatraz. How does
        Mark Rober "Mark Rober" his way out of Alcatraz?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: (deep breath) Yeah, I'm
        goin' to El Chapo, baby. I'm digging a tunnel.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: (laughs)</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: That's- I'll invent a
        machine that's, like, the fastest digging tunnel machine and that's how
        I'm gettin' out, I think. I'm callin' it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Maybe there's a
        colaboration with Colin Furze and, uh- and digging his tunnel.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Dah! (laughs)</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Digging the tunnel out
        of, uh- of jail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Good point. I feel like
        I've- I'm on Colin's grass here on this one. Alright, well if I get one
        call- phone call from jail, you know who it's going to now, sorry Mom,
        I'm callin' Colin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="colin-furze">Colin Furze</strong> (clip from Colin's
        video): Ohohoho! You've got a lot of tidyin' up to do here, Furze. You
        got a lot of tidyin' up!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Alright, well thanks for
        the call and by the way, thanks for, uh, bein' a lawyer and, uh, you
        making me sleep a little bit better at night. Sometimes it's a little
        sketchy with these things, so knowing a lawyer of your caliber has
        looked at this and-and cleared my name, uh, means I can rest a little
        easier and there's a higher probability we'll do Glitterbomb 5.0 and 6
        and 7 and who knows where we'll be at when we get to Glitterbomb 10.0
        but.... Now, if I ever get sued, uh, I'm sendin' 'em your way. You-
        you're my representation at this point, so thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Thanks so much for
        joining, Mark. I'll send you my engagement letter and you can send me a
        retainer.

      <p><strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>t: Pfft! Lame!</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: (laughs) Yeah,
        theoretically. Theoretically, they should be bound by the Constitution
        and you get people saying, "Oh, that infringes on my First Amendment
        rights," when it doesn't actually involve the government and the First
        Amendment doesn't apply to anything but the government. You are a
        private citizen so there are rules that define what the government can
        do with information that's created by private citizens. Mark, I noticed
        that a lot of people in your videos have blurred faces. Is there a
        particular reason why you do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: We might as well just
        state it on your channel. I put this in descriptions sometimes. But
        basically, if someone doesn't signa release, their face is then blurred
        and I don't want to ruin anyone's life over a stupid decision to steal a
        package. So, by default, faces are blurred. If you see a face that's not
        blurred, that's because they signed a release and we went back later and
        said, "Hey, will you sign a release so I could put this in a dumb
        video?" And they've signed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Are you able to
        prevent future package thieves?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: It's kind of a
        case-by-case basis. There's one two years ago, these two college
        students took it and they were hilarious. I didn't end up turning their
        footage to the police or anything but then Discover Channel tracked them
        down and then I interviewed them. And I asked them, "So have you guys
        stolen any packages since?" And they're like, "Ah man, I got in so much
        trouble from my mom and my grandma." And then they're like, a package
        came to their house accidentally, just shipped to the wrong address and
        he's like, "I frickin' personally walked that thing to Georgia where it
        actually was supposed to deliver to. I didn't want anything to do with
        it." He was like, "I was going to go through hell or high water to make
        sure it got to the right person." So I was like, "Ah, well, my job is
        done here." I think they learned their lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Well, Mark, if Batman
        had a YouTube channel, I think he would aspire to do exactly what you're
        doing. I think you're doing really good work. My final question for you
        is: If Mark Rober found himself in jail, how would he engineer his way
        out of imprisonment?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: (laughs) Ah, man. What
        kind of jail is it? I got to know what the weaknesses are, right? And it
        usually, I think, those things come down to a little bit of a
        combination of social engineering. You kind of got to observe, know when
        the guards gone rest, make friends with the guard, you know? Depends on
        how long the jail sentence was because, also, I'm not going to break out
        if that gives me 20 more years. So, you got to balance it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Let's say you're
        wrongfully imprisoned for life. You are a completely innocent man but
        you have no hope of parole and you're in Alcatraz. How does Mark Rober
        "Mark Rober" his way out of Alcatraz?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Yeah, I'm going to El
        Chapo, baby. I'm digging a tunnel.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: (laughs)</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: I'll invent a machine
        that's the fastest digging tunnel machine and that's how I'm getting
        out, I think. I'm calling it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Maybe there's a
        colaboration with Colin Furze and digging his tunnel.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: (laughs)</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Digging the tunnel out
        of jail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Good point. I feel like
        I'm on Colin's grass here on this one. Alright, well if I get one phone
        call from jail, you know who it's going to now. Sorry Mom, I'm calling
        Colin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="colin-furze">Colin Furze</strong>: Oh! You've got a lot
        of tidying up to do here, Furze. You got a lot of tidying up!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="mark-rober">Mark Rober</strong>: Alright, well, thanks
        for the call and, by the way, thanks for being a lawyer and you making
        me sleep a little bit better at night. Sometimes it's a little sketchy
        with these things so knowing a lawyer of your caliber has looked at this
        and cleared my name means I can rest a little easier and there's a
        higher probability we'll do Glitterbomb 5.0 and 6 and 7 and who know
        where we'll be at when we get to Glitterbomb 10.0. Now, if I ever get
        sued, I'm sending them your way. You're my representation at this point,
        so thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="legal-eagle">Legal Eagle</strong>: Thanks so much for
        joining, Mark. I'll send you my engagement letter and you can send me a
        retainer.
      </p>
